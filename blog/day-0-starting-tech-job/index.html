      <h2>Day 0: How to make your first day great!</h2>
      <h4>7:50 AM October 24th, 2017</h4>

      As a recent grad, I just started my first job as a software engineer at a tech company. Even after a few
      internships, the step to fulltime is still a new milestone.<br><br>

      <h3>Day 0:</h3>
      On my first day, I feel the most important part is to have a structured approach to everything: technical and
      social challenges. <br><br>

      <!-- TODO: add AGILE book link -->
      <b>Learn the Development Environment:</b>
      Firstly, I tried to learn more about the new software development cycle environment. For me, this was AGILE. There
      exist great resources on learning the OODA Loop philosophy such as <a class="no-underline" href="www.google.com">
        link here</a>.<br><br>

      <!-- TODO: add Jira link -->
      <b>Use the Development Environment Tools:</b>
      Secondly, after applying what I know about the software development cycle, I utilize the development tools like <a
        class="no-underline" href="www.google.com">Jira</a>. In Jira, I can look at what epics the team is working on
      currently and get a better idea of the systems the team owns by their referenced links to github repos and
      associated documentation.<br><br>

      <b>Figure out your role:</b>
      After getting a general idea of the team's systems through documentation. I reach out to my team. Within the first
      week or two of starting, I like to schedule some time with each of my coworkers to ask them:<br><br>
      <li>what they do</li>
      <li>what systems they own</li>
      <li>a brief architectural overview</li>
      <li>how I can help</li><br><br>

      <b>Permissions!!! </b>
      An underrated topic is permissions: make sure you have all the permissions you need to the systems you want. This
      may have been overlooked by whomever sets these settings.
