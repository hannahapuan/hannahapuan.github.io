					<p class="lead"><a name="approach-to-plain-language">Approach to Plain Language:</a></p>
					The approach to plain language that our group will take, will be explaining the more complicated and lesser known technologies that we are discussing. There is also a glossary of technical terms within this style guide. We will have individuals read over our work before it is published to confirm that it is usable and easily understandable, while still explaining the technical aspects of the artifact well. The language will be written in an eloquent informative manner to increase user appeal. This will be executed through smooth, fact driven, descriptive language. 
					<br>
					<p class="lead"><br><a name="header-format">Header Format:</a></p>
					<p>The headers of section within a main topic are 18 bold font chosen to give the reader distinction about the segments discussed throughout the main topic. Additionally, the main topic is 24 bold font. This is the largest font used to indicate sections of overarching importance and the main theme. The authors of the writing’s name always appear in 12 font in the left top corner of the page. The date the article was published/written always appears in the top right corner in italicized 12 font. These locations were chosen for easy reference. The font size is size 12 to prevent drawing attention to the lower significant items on the informative page. </p>
					<br>
					<p class="lead"><a name="poster-standards">Poster Standards:</a></p>
					<p>The poster follows the font and color standards set forth by this guide. The poster was designed to split explanation by 50% figures and visual explanations and 50% written statistics of the Model 3. In addition to the already set style standards, the poster also has subtitles of size 18 pt in Consolas that are bolded and italicized. For brevity, citations are represented as numbers which reference the numbered sources at the bottom right of the poster. The language of the poster communicates an intellectual and informative tone for optimal comprehension from poster-readers.

					</p>
					<p class="lead"><a name="poster-standards">Document Standards:</a></p>
					<p>For our font choice, we we want something visually appealing and tasteful, however, not distracting. We have chosen 14 point font for regular text, 18 and bold for headers and bold, and 24, bold, and centered for titles. Key words in our glossary will be underlined in order to draw attention to the term and hope it sticks with the reader. The margins will be 0.75” x 0.75”. Spacing of text will be 1.15.</p>
