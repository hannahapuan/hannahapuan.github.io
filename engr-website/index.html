					<h1>Approach to Plain Language:</h1>
					<p class="lead"><a name="header-format">Header Format:</a></p>
					<p>The headers of section within a main topic are 18 bold font chosen to give the reader distinction about the segments discussed throughout the main topic. Additionally, the main topic is 24 bold font. This is the largest font used to indicate sections of overarching importance and the main theme. The authors of the writing’s name always appear in 12 font in the left top corner of the page. The date the article was published/written always appears in the top right corner in italicized 12 font. These locations were chosen for easy reference. The font size is size 12 to prevent drawing attention to the lower significant items on the informative page. </p>

					<p>For our font choice, we we want something visually appealing and tasteful, however, not distracting. We have chosen 14 point font for regular text, 18 and bold for headers and bold, and 24, bold, and centered for titles. Key words in our glossary will be underlined in order to draw attention to the term and hope it sticks with the reader. The margins will be 0.75” x 0.75”. Spacing of text will be 1.15.</p>
